# Best Friends Dashboard

With today's technology nothing can keep two best friends apart. Even if they are located on opposite sides of the world, there are numerous technologies that can put them directly in contact with one another.

Let's say two friends are living in Tokyo and San Francisco; whenever they talk they tend to ask how the weather is, the latest regional news, etc. Instead of repetitively asking for this information directly from each other why not just have a page that puts all this information into one aggregated space - a dashboard!


## Widget Ideas

* Weather
* Time
* Currency exchange rate
* Site traffic stats
* Articles (Drudge, Hackernews, etc)
* Git activity
* Japanese word of the day

## Setup

```bash
yarn global add parcel-bundler
yarn # install deps
yarn start # start dev server, visit the link shown in terminal
```
